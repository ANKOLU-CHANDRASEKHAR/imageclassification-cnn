# Image Classification Using CNN

> This project was developed as a college minor project for the B.Tech curriculum.

## Description
This project implements an Image Classification system using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images as Cats or Dogs.

## Dataset
Dogs vs Cats dataset from Kaggle:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
- code/ : Model training and prediction scripts
- report/ : Complete project report (PDF)
- screenshots/ : Output images and accuracy graphs

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries using `requirements.txt`
2. Run `train_model.py` to train the CNN model
3. Run `predict.py` to test a new image

## Output
- `0` → Cat  
- `1` → Dog
